# Presentations

### A place where i store all the presentations i've done over the years.

I sometimes use slide animations in my powerpoints, these are lost in the conversion to PDF, so they may be hard to understand. If the content is unclear try viewing the powerpoint version of the presentations. I am planning converting these problematic slides so they're more readable in pdf form, but may have not gottten to it yet.
