*WARNING*
This Lab zips (especially lab 2) may trigger your antivirus due to a binary related to a remote access tool. The executable in this case is a copy of client32.exe from NetSupport. The config ini has been neutered to not work with a malicious domain, but may still be an issue.

*YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED*.

Password for the zips is "infected" (the industry standard for malware samples).
